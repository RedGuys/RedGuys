I am interested in developing in various languages, mainly Java and JavaScript.<br>
I really love development, almost every day I sit down at the computer and immerse myself in this amazing world.<br>
Now I work for the Storytelling Team and develop my own developments such as the [Imperium Guard](https://t.me/imperium_guard_bot) and the [Underground Transcriber](https://t.me/PWVoiceBot).<br>
I continue to learn Java, JavaScript and JapanðŸŽŒ<br>
